# YTPlaylistInstaller
My first public coding project
Used github desktop and completely written in IDLE (yes really) and commits are createed using the github desktop client

I was very new to git so i still made and used backups manually at the time [bleach your eyes](https://github.com/TheDahoom/YTPlaylistInstaller/tree/master/Main/Backups)

## Old content
first project, just exploring and having fun (very primitive and currently unfinished)
