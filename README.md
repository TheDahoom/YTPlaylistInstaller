# YTPlaylistInstaller
My first public coding project
Used github desktop and completely written in IDLE (yes really) <img width="479" alt="ðŸ¤®" src="https://github.com/TheDahoom/YTPlaylistInstaller/assets/105564371/25f86041-c1a7-4c87-a0ac-7c468c22a7bf">

Commits were created using the github desktop client.
Very primitive code and this was effectively just me furiously tapping keys until something worked through trail and error.

I was very new to git so i still made and used backups manually at the time [bleach your eyes](https://github.com/TheDahoom/YTPlaylistInstaller/tree/master/Main/Backups)

## legacy readme content
first project, just exploring and having fun (very primitive and currently unfinished)
